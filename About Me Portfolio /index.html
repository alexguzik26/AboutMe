  <div class="Interviews"><h1>Qualitative Interviews</h1><p>Due to user research being so essential to the design process and good design, interviews are equally important to gather that data. With several years working in the customer service industry I have gained skills on how connect with people and how to better understand their needs by asking the right questions.</p><h1>User Empathy</h1><p>User empathy is very important and with many years working 
      with people being personable with users is what I focus on. This allows me to understand their feeling and emotions towards a certain product or an area of a product. </p></div>
